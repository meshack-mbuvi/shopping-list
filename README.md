# shopping-list
## Project Overview
Shopping-list app is an application that helps users manage a list of items they plan to shop for. This enables them to have an account of what they have already shopped for versus what is not yet shopped for. This removes the need to walk with written document since they can add the items to the system and then log in to the application to view their list.
